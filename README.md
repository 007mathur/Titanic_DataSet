# Titanic Dataset
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.<br>
<br>
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.<br>
<br>
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.<br>
<br>
The Dataset is picked from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) <br>
<br>
I've used Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Neural Networks, two of my most favourite types of ML classification algorithms, to train two models on the this dataset.<br>
Upon submission on kaggle the accuracies obtained were:<br>
1. SVM - 76.55%
2. Neural Networks - 73.45%
<br>
